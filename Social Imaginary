Stories give rise to group coherence. This next generation of stories needs to sense and appreciate the sacred in the secular. It needs to make sense, and be profound. We believe everything needed for that is already here. We just need to make sense of it.

> The answer to the question 'What should I believe, and why should I believe it?' is generally a scientific one. Believe a proposition because it is well-supported by theory and evidence; believe it because it has been experimentally verified; believe it because a generation of smart people have tried their best to falsify it and failed; believe it because it is *true* (or seems so). This is a norm of cognition as well as the core of any scientific mission statement. As far as our understanding of the world is concerned — **there are no facts without values.** Sam Harris

we need a sense of common something, values, narrative, common sense,

without the story being fully conscious, we‘re already gravitating towards it

Separation → Interbeing

Scarcity → Abundance

Finite → Infinite Games

complex social organization, a capacity for empathy and a capacity for conceptual thought

What are the first principles / generator functions of the wisdom that shapes this imaginary?

# Threat

the tree should go from meta, deep cause to more instantiated effects

**Extinction**

Meta crisis of civilization, meaning crisis, climate crisis

Depression, anxiety, loneliness 

existential risk: incoherence, rivalrous games x exponential tech

> If we are gaining the power of gods, then without the love and wisdom of gods, we self-destruct. Daniel Schmachtenberger

Addictive need to consume

disconnection

addiction = the attempt to meet the need with a substitute that doesn‘t actually meet the need

supernormal stimuli: porn, cocaine, social media, processed food

tribalism, polarization

## Planetary

## Collective

## Individual

## Crisis

- belonging → danger of simplified dialoque for the sake of us-vs-them weaponized communication
- meaning
- sense-making collectively
- choice-making collectively

> People could get despairing or overwhelmed. They could also also consider that this is the most interesting possible time to have an opportunity to contribute to a deeper level shift than anyone has ever had. Daniel Schmachtenberger

# Opportunity

→ **Utopia**, a desirable & sustainable future

> Utopias are often only premature truths. Alphonse De Lamartine

interbeing & abundance

Earth as living & sacred → conservation, regeneration, pollution, greenhouse gases

**Becoming conscious agents in...**
→ in the next major transition in evolution: species level coherence
→ the healing of the earth, becoming net-positive to nature

Focused on human behavior and capability, more than on outcome. → [Vision of Human Capability](https://www.notion.so/64ef3dc8-821c-4133-9f01-325689ce3e88) 

Individual: Meaning! an organizing principle that centers around getting your needs met and fully empowering you to bring your gift to the world

We see a unique opportunity to collectively align our behavior with our values, our culture with our wisdom. Ubiquitous internet access gave rise to digital social systems that connect billions of people. We believe these systems can be designed in a way that unites our species in what makes us human.

more intentionality, meaning and happiness, instead of addiction, consumption and pleasure.

A world where each of us are empowered to become **bodhisattva** (all aware/all caring), **polymath** (all knowing), **world-creator** (all powerful) to the fullest extent of our capacity.

# Virtue

What leaders are supposed to possess, why we need new leaders

## **Sovereignty**

### Sentience → Bodhisattva

Ever-increasing circle of empathy 
→ Beyond us vs them

### Intelligence → Polymath

Omni-consideration, omni-positive choice making 

### Agency → World-creator

Capacity to see Omni-positive Choices whereever possible → what makes people capable of seeing and appreciating omni-positive choices?

What are the agreements that are consistent with the world we want to live in?

The type of humility that comes from thinking well, studying nature, awe of complex systems

- embodied interbeing
- seeking deep insights about the nature of reality
- bridging science and spirituality
- clarity and integrity
- intuition for our highest values, our collective best interest

**The five foundations of descriptive morality**

Care / Harm → Caring, Kindness

Fairness / Cheating → Fairness, justice, trustworthiness

Loyalty / betrayal → Loyalty, patriotism, self-sacrifice

Authority / Subversion → Obedience, deference (→ reason, scientific inquery)

Sanctity / degradation → Temperance, chastity, piety, cleanliness

## Quality — What makes a good social imaginary?

**Simplicity.** The story has to be easily teachable and easily understandable. → TL;DR ELI5 for every summary and 

**Unfalsifiability.** The story can’t be easy to disprove. → True, scientifically verified, reasoned from first principles

**Conviction.** For a story to take hold, its hosts can’t be *wondering* or *hypothesizing* or vaguely believing—the story needs to be specific and to posit itself as the *absolute truth*.

**Contagiousness.** Next, the story needs to spread. If a particular virus were great at binding only to a random man in Minnesota named Skip Walker, it might have a good run while Skip was alive, but it would die with Skip. Likewise, a story about a god that created only Skip Walker, was only concerned with Skip Walker, and had a place in heaven only for Skip Walker wouldn’t make it very far. Skip probably wouldn’t get a great reaction telling people about that story, and others would have no motivation to adopt it or share it with anybody else. To be spreadable, a story needs to be contagious—something people feel deeply compelled to share and that applies equally to many people.

The story, once believed, needs to be able to drive the behavior of its host. So it should include:

**Incentives.** Promises of treats for behaving the right way, promises of electroshocks for behaving the wrong way.

**Accountability.** The claim that your behavior will be known by the arbiter of the incentives—even, in some cases, where no one is around to see it.

**Comprehensiveness.** The story can dictate what’s true and false, virtuous and immoral, valuable and worthless, important and irrelevant, covering the full spectrum of human belief.

supernatural, sacred
